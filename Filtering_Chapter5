#Resequencing Filtering
#-v snps selects for SNPs only.
# -m2 -M2 selects for biallelic SNPs.
# -q 0.05:minor is an MAF cutoff of 0.05 (could also use the filter MAF option, but this seems to work well)
# AVG(FMT/DP)>10 is an average minimum depth of 10.
# %QUAL>20 filters for quality above 20.

#prunes for LD R2 of 0.6 with a window of 1000bp
#-e excludes sites that have more than 0.1 missingness.
